# Unix-Timestamp-Rechner

Welcome to the Unix Timestamp Calculator repository! This Java program allows you to convert between Unix timestamps and human-readable dates.
This Project was created by a beginner to learn Java and its different Functions. I know that there is room for improvement.

## Overview

The Unix Timestamp Rechner is a simple Java program designed to facilitate the conversion between Unix timestamps and standard date formats. Whether you have a date and want to find its Unix timestamp or vice versa, this tool has got you covered.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/H14d3n/Timestamp-Calculator.git
   cd Timestamp-Calculator.git

2. Compile and run the program using the following commands:
   ```bash
   javac Timestamp.java
   java Timestamp

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired action:
   
* Calculate a timestamp from a given date.
* Calculate a date from a given timestamp.
* Learn more about Unix time.

### Unix Time Explaination
The Unix time is a time representation developed for the Unix operating system and established as the POSIX standard. It counts the elapsed seconds since Thursday, January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTCâ€”also known as The Epoch. The transition from one second to the next is synchronized with UTC.

Before Unix Version 6 (1975), the Unix clock counted in hundredths of a second, requiring the Epoch to be reset each year. For a more in-depth explanation, run the program and choose option 3.
